# Interactive Bento Grid Gallery

A responsive, modern image gallery built using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**. This project focuses on mastering layout techniques, hover transitions, and background image blending.

## 🚀 Features
* **Bento-style Grid:** Utilizes `grid-template-columns` and `grid-row/column: span` for a dynamic layout.
* **Flexbox Layout:** Side-by-side arrangement for descriptive text and the gallery.
* **Hover Effects:** Smooth scaling (`transform: scale(1.1)`) and vertical movement on text.
* **Background Blending:** Uses `background-blend-mode: hard-light` for a stylized dark-to-light image effect.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom properties, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Transitions.
